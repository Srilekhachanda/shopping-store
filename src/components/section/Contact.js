             <h2>Apple store special</h2>
             <p>At the Apple Store, the main focus of the sales assistants is the overall customer 
                 experience. Employees are not paid commission,
                  and are therefore not concentrated on closing sales,
                   or advising the most expensive items. 
                   The Apple Store's final aim, as it was conceived by Steve Jobs, is to “enrich lives”</p>
